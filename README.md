POMODORO TIMER

• Created a fully functional pomodoro timer with MySQL as the back end and Reactjs as the front end.

• Utilized React hooks such as useEffect, useState and useRef.

• Utilized HTML and CSS to create timers, buttons and backrounds.

NOTE: Since this is a full stack project the website can not be displayed in github so I have attatched all the files which I have edited.
