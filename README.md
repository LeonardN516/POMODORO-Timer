POMODORO TIMER

• Created a fully functional pomodoro timer with MySQL as the back end and Reactjs as the front end.

•Utilized React hooks such as useEffect, useState and useRef.

•Utilized HTML and CSS to create timers, buttons and backrounds.

NOTE: since this is a full stack project the webisite can not be displayed in github i have attatched all the files which I have edited.
